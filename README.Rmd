`rpigpior` allows the R programming language access to the Raspberry Pi
GPIO using libgpiod. Because libgpiod is already included in Raspbian,
there is nothing else to install.

`rpigpior` provides these tools:

-   is.rpi - Returns TRUE if this code is running under Raspbian
-   rpi_get - Returns the value of a board level pin (1-40) or an error
    if the pin isn't a data line (3.3v, 5v, or GROUND)
-   rpi_set - Sets a pin to on or off
-   rpi_monitor - watches a pin for a number of rising or falling events

## Installation

`rpigpior` is hosted on github. Until it arrives at cran, you can
install the development version of rpigpior from
[GitHub](https://github.com/mnr/rpigpior) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("mnr/rpigpior")
```

Most documentation will tell you to use devtools, but
`install.packages("devtools")` on a Raspberry Pi is an onerous task.

Once you've installed, use `library` just like any other R package:

``` r
library(rpigpior)
```
