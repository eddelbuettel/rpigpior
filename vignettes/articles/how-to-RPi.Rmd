# How to set up R for a Raspberry Pi

This document describes how to set up the R programming language on a Raspberry Pi.

## A brief overview of the Raspberry Pi

Hopefully this really isn't necessary, but you may wonder why there's a fuss about the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com). Here's a few tidbits to get you started:

-   It's a full-blown Linux computer, supports HDMI, ethernet, audio, a camera, USB and runs on five volts DC. It consumes somewhere around 3 to 6 watts.

-   See those dual rows of pins? That's the *General Purpose Input/Output* (GPIO) pins. You can read and write to the outside world, plus support a wide array of sensors.

-   There is lots of support for programming with Python

-   Depending on the model you need, you could get your hands on a Raspberry Pi for somewhere between \$5 and \$45 USD.

## Install R

The Raspberry Pi doesn't come with R so you'll need to install it. You might want to check out [R4Pi](https://r4pi.org), a website that provides precompiled binaries.

If the R4Pi website isn't up and running, simply fall back to apt-get...

``` r
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-core
```

That's dependable.

## Fix the App Menu

Unfortunately, the installer places R in the graphic menu instead of programming tools.

![R appears in the graphic menu](fixtheapp.png){fig-alt="Image showing how to fix the app location in Raspbian"}

That works, but it's just annoying. To move it to the programming menu:

1.  Go to the RPi menu (Raspberry Pi in the upper left).

2.  Select Preferences

3.  Select Main Menu Editor. This provides a dialog.

4.  In that dialog, select programming.

5.  On the right, select New Item:

6.  In the dialog, fill in the fields with:

    1.  Name=R

    2.  Command=R

    3.  Launch in terminal. OK

Presto change-O. R is now in the programming menu.

## Fix the Icon

Almost done with this trivial stuff, but the Icon for the R app is wrong. Let's fix it...

![](fixtheicon.png){fig-alt="Image showing how to fix the icon for R"}

1.  In the Raspberry Pi menu, right click on R.

2.  Choose Properties

3.  Click on the Icon to bring up the chooser

4.  In the System Theme, select *rlogo.icon*

## Setup geany

Apparently posit is working on a version of RStudio for Raspberry Pi. But as of the creation of this document, it's not ready for prime time. I use Geany instead - it's installed on the Raspberry Pi, it's an IDE, and it's better than a poke in the eye.
