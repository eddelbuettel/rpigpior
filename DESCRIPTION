Description: This provides R with access to the Raspberry Pi General Purpose 
    Input Output (GPIO) via libgpiod. This includes detecting a gpio chip as 
    well as turning pins on and off via gpioset() and reading the state of pins 
    via gpioget(). No additional libraries need to be installed; Raspbian includes 
    libgpiod as part of the standard installation.
